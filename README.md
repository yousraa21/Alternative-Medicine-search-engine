# Alternative-Medicine-search-engine
This project contains a Python script (gui.py) for a graphical user interface (GUI) that performs search and query expansion on a dataset related to alternative medicine. The GUI was generated using Tkinter Designer by Parth Jadhav.
Features

    Search Functionality: Allows users to search the dataset using boolean and TF-IDF based queries.
    Query Expansion: Expands user queries by extracting relevant terms from top-ranked documents.
    Results Display: Displays the search results within the GUI.
    Preprocessing: Preprocesses the dataset for effective searching.
    Inverted Index Creation: Builds an inverted index for efficient query processing.
    Weight Calculation: Calculates weights (TF-IDF scores) for terms in the dataset.
    Requirements

    Python 3.x
    Tkinter
    NLTK

You can install the necessary packages using pip:```pip install nltk```

How to Run:

1 Clone this repository:```git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git```.
 2 Navigate to the project directory: ```cd your-repo-name```.
3 Run the GUI script: ```python gui.py```.
